VAGRANT_PREFER_SYSTEM_BIN

If this is set, Vagrant will prefer using utility executables (like ssh and rsync) from the local system instead of those vendored within the Vagrant installation.

Vagrant will default to using a system provided ssh on Windows. This environment variable can also be used to disable that behavior to force Vagrant to use the embedded ssh executable by setting it to 0.

if vagrant ssh returns permission denied
